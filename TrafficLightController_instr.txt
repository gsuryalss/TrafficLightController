Objective:
To implement an automated traffic light controller in single circuit using Arduino.

Components needed:
Arduino UNO
1 switch
10kohm resistor (pull down)
1 Red LED
1 Yellow LED
1 Green LED
3 220 ohm resistors

Pin Logics:
2 - input
3, 4, 5 output
3 - G
4 - Y
5 - R

Pseudo code:
a) initialize the ports (2,3,4,5)
b) when the switch is open, Green LED glows.
c) when the switch is closed, Yellow LED glows for 5 secs and then Red Led glows for 15 secs.
d) b & c steps run indefinitely in the loop routine.
